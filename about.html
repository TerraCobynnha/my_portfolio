            <p>Terra Baffoe Andoh is a soon to graduate Bsc. Computer Science student at the University of Ghana, Legon (June, 2020). He's based at Tema in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Most of the time he's glued to his computer's screen either learning a new programming technology or pracitising what he's learned already. Diligence is what he attaches to whatever he does so that the flaws are reduced to the possible minimum. He's interested in web development, programming and networking just to mention a few.<br /> Enjoying good music, having a nice time with family and friends, watching football and helping others are some of the things he enjoys doing when he's not glued to a computer screen learning.</p>
